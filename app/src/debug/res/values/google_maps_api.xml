    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    5C:FF:EF:FD:30:A2:80:8E:EB:07:04:36:C8:26:D1:DE:4D:AF:26:C2

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    5C:FF:EF:FD:30:A2:80:8E:EB:07:04:36:C8:26:D1:DE:4D:AF:26:C2

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
